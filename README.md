# IOT-based-Smart-Attendance-System-with-WebApp
# Abstract
Taking attendance manually in class of students consumes a lot of time which could be used for other useful work. Also, manual attendance is not reliable as the chances of people giving proxy attendance is also very high, especially when the strength of the class is high. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based attendance system is discussed here which makes attendance taking much more reliable and less cumbersome. COVID-19 has also made it necessary to ensure that students who show symptoms of the disease like high temperature are not allowed to enter the class. So, a non-contact MLX90614 temperature sensor is also used to accurately monitor the temperature of the students entering the class. Each student is uniquely identified with the help of their RFID tag when it is scanned and details like the Student ID, time, temperature and date are recorded. The recorded information is sent to a database where it is stored and can later be used. The website and database also make it unnecessary to maintain physical attendance records and monitoring of attendance is much easier than with physical records, apart from being secure. Random forest regressor model has been used to predict future attendance and visualization of trends has been performed.
